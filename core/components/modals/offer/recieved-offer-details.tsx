              outlined and communicated to freelancers and clients.
              <br />
              2.2 The service fee will be deducted automatically from the total
              payment made by the client to the freelancer.

              <br />
              <span className="font-semibold">3. Payment Disputes</span>
              <br />
              3.1 In the event of a payment dispute, both the client and the
              freelancer should attempt to resolve the matter amicably and
              professionally.

              3.3 Codery will review the dispute and make a fair and impartial
              decision based on the available information.
              <br />

                4. Payment Security and Confidentiality

              <br />

              including any conditions or fees associated with cancellations or

              jurisdictions.
